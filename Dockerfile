# Reduce the number of layers in image by minimizing the number of separate RUN commands
# 1 - Install GCC, Git, Python 3.11, libraries needed for Python development, and pcre needed by uwsgi
# 2 - Set default Python version for `python` command, `python3` already points to the newly installed Python3.9
# 3 - Upgrade pip, after upgrading, both pip and pip3 are the same version
# 4 - Pip install wheel and uwsgi packages. Pip uses wheel to install uwsgi
# 5 - Clean all yum cache

# Install su-exec for de-elevating root to deepphe user
# N.B. git and gcc are also needed for su-exec installation, but since already
#      added for uwsgi, they are simply used and are not removed like compilation-only packages.
